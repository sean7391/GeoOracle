State of the art geolocation model for GeoGuessr. 

This respository contains the model code and sematic geocell algorithm code for my GeoGuessr AI. Image collection code as well as my datasets are not provided to prevent abuse and cheating with the bot. 

I'm currently finetuning the model but a preliminary video will be uploaded to YT soon demonstrating the performance of the base model. Its performance is comparable (if not better) to that of a professional GeoGuessr player.
